Step 1: Configure IPsec on Device A and Device B
On Both Devices (Device A and Device B):

Install StrongSwan for IPsec:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install strongswan
Edit IPsec Configuration on Each Device:

Open the file /etc/ipsec.conf on both devices and add the IPsec configuration.
Configuration for Device A:
Replace <IP_of_Device_A> with the IP address of Device A and <IP_of_Device_B> with the IP address of Device B.
(Yes, the commands ifconfig or ip addr show will show you both the IP addresses and the subnet masks associated with each network interface on a device.)

conf
Copy code
config setup
  charondebug="ike 2, knl 2, cfg 2"

conn myconnection
  authby=secret
  left=<IP_of_Device_A>
  leftsubnet=192.168.1.0/24     # Replace with Device A's subnet
  right=<IP_of_Device_B>
  rightsubnet=192.168.2.0/24    # Replace with Device B's subnet
  ike=aes256-sha256-modp1024    # IKE Phase 1 settings
  esp=aes256-sha256-modp1024    # ESP and AH Phase 2 settings
  keyexchange=ikev2
  type=tunnel
  auto=start
Configuration for Device B:
This will be the same as Device A, but left and right will be reversed:

conf
Copy code
config setup
  charondebug="ike 2, knl 2, cfg 2"

conn myconnection
  authby=secret
  left=<IP_of_Device_B>
  leftsubnet=192.168.2.0/24     # Device B's subnet
  right=<IP_of_Device_A>
  rightsubnet=192.168.1.0/24    # Device A's subnet
  ike=aes256-sha256-modp1024
  esp=aes256-sha256-modp1024
  keyexchange=ikev2
  type=tunnel
  auto=start
Set Up Shared Secrets:

Edit /etc/ipsec.secrets on both devices to define a shared key:
conf
Copy code
<IP_of_Device_A> <IP_of_Device_B> : PSK "yoursharedsecret"
Step 2: Restart the IPsec Service on Both Devices
Run the following command on both Device A and Device B:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart strongswan
Step 3: Verify IPsec Connection
Check IPsec Status on Each Device:

On both Device A and Device B, check the IPsec tunnel status:
bash
Copy code
sudo ipsec statusall
Generate Traffic from Device A to Device B to Trigger the IPsec Tunnel:

On Device A, try pinging Device B’s IP:
bash
Copy code
ping <IP_of_Device_B>
Step 4: Capture IPsec Packets on Device A (or a Monitoring Device)
Start Wireshark on Device A or Another Device on the Same Network:

Set the capture filter to capture IPsec ESP and AH packets:
For ESP packets: ip.proto == 50
For AH packets: ip.proto == 51
Analyze the Packets:

Look for ESP and AH packets to confirm the IPsec encryption is in place.

What is IPsec, and what does it do?

IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) is a protocol suite that provides data authentication, integrity, and confidentiality over IP networks​(EXPT_10).
What are ESP and AH in IPsec?

ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) provides confidentiality, while AH (Authentication Header) provides authentication and integrity​(EXPT_10).
What is ISAKMP, and why is it important for IPsec?

ISAKMP (Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol) manages security associations and key exchanges essential for establishing IPsec connections​(EXPT_10).
What are the differences between IPsec transport mode and tunnel mode?

In transport mode, only the IP payload is encrypted/authenticated. In tunnel mode, the entire IP packet is encapsulated and encrypted​(EXPT_10).
What are some applications of IPsec?

IPsec is commonly used in VPNs to secure data transmitted over the internet​(EXPT_10).
What ports and protocols are used by IPsec?

IPsec uses UDP port 500 for ISAKMP and IP protocols 50 (ESP) and 51 (AH)​(EXPT_10).
How does IPsec prevent replay attacks?

IPsec uses sequence numbers and anti-replay windows to protect against replay attacks​(EXPT_10).
