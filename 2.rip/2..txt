What is the aim of this experiment?

Answer: The aim is to configure a 3-router network using routing protocols like RIP, OSPF, or BGP in Cisco Packet Tracer.
What are routing protocols?

Answer: Routing protocols determine the path for data packets in a network. They help routers communicate and update routing tables. Common protocols include RIP (Routing Information Protocol), OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).
Can you explain the Routing Information Protocol (RIP)?

Answer: RIP is a distance-vector protocol that uses hop count as a metric for path selection. It limits the number of hops to 15, and a hop count of 16 means the route is unreachable. RIP prevents routing loops through split horizon, route poisoning, and hold-down mechanisms.
What is OSPF, and how does it differ from RIP?

Answer: OSPF is a link-state protocol used within a single autonomous system. Unlike RIP, which uses hop count, OSPF constructs a topology map based on link-state information and calculates the shortest path, making it more efficient for larger networks.
What are some key differences between RIPv1 and RIPv2?

Answer: RIPv1 does not support subnet masks and broadcasts updates, while RIPv2 supports classless routing with subnet masks and multicasts updates, making it more secure and efficient.
How is RIP configured in Cisco Packet Tracer?

Answer: RIP is configured by enabling the router, entering configuration mode, and using router rip, followed by version 2 and specifying network addresses connected to the router.
What is a wildcard mask in OSPF configuration?

Answer: In OSPF, a wildcard mask identifies which parts of an IP address to consider when applying OSPF to interfaces. It specifies which bits are variable, allowing fine-grained control over advertised networks.
