What is DNS, and why is it needed?

DNS (Domain Name System) maps domain names to IP addresses, making it easier for users to access websites without remembering numeric IP addresses​(EXPT_11 (1)).
Explain the hierarchical structure of the Domain Name System.

DNS uses a hierarchical structure with multiple levels, including root, top-level domains (TLDs), second-level domains, and subdomains​(EXPT_11 (1)).
What is the difference between a flat and hierarchical namespace?

A flat namespace assigns names without structure, while a hierarchical namespace organizes names in levels, reducing ambiguity and enabling scalability​(EXPT_11 (1)).
What is a DNS resolver?

A DNS resolver is a client that queries DNS servers to resolve domain names into IP addresses or vice versa​(EXPT_11 (1)).
What is recursive resolution in DNS?

Recursive resolution involves a DNS server querying other DNS servers to provide a final answer to the client without requiring further requests from the client​(EXPT_11 (1)).
What are the primary record types used in DNS?

Common record types include A (Address), MX (Mail Exchange), NS (Name Server), and PTR (Pointer) records​(EXPT_11 (1)).
How does DNS caching improve efficiency?

DNS caching stores query results temporarily, allowing faster access to previously resolved domain names without repeated lookups​(EXPT_11 (1)).
