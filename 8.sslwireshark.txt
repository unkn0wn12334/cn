What is SSL, and why is it important?

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a protocol that provides privacy, authentication, and data integrity in internet communications. It's crucial because it encrypts sensitive data, preventing unauthorized access​(EXPT_8).
How does the SSL/TLS handshake process work?

The handshake involves steps like exchanging hello messages, server authentication through certificates, key exchange, and switching to an encrypted connection​(EXPT_8).
What are the main components of SSL?

SSL consists of authentication, encryption, and data integrity, each ensuring the safety of transmitted data​(EXPT_8).
On which layer of the OSI model does SSL operate?

SSL operates at the transport layer (Layer 4), securing TCP connections​(EXPT_8).
What is the purpose of the "Client Hello" message in the SSL handshake?

The Client Hello message initiates the SSL handshake and includes information like supported cipher suites and compression methods​(EXPT_8).
Why was SSL replaced by TLS?

SSL was replaced by TLS to address vulnerabilities and improve security; TLS provides stronger encryption and better data integrity verification​(EXPT_8).
What are common SSL/TLS attacks, and how does SSL prevent them?

Common attacks include man-in-the-middle attacks and replay attacks. SSL mitigates these by using authentication and encryption​(EXPT_8).
