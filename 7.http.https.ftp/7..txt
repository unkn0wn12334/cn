What is FTP, and how is it used?

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used to transfer files between a client and server on a network. It operates on a client-server model where the client can upload, download, or manage files on the server.
Describe the main difference between HTTP and HTTPS.

HTTP is a protocol for transferring data over the web, while HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, which uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data in transit.
What are some common FTP commands, and their functions?

put uploads a file to the server, get downloads a file, delete removes a file on the server, and rename changes a file's name on the server.
Explain how Packet Tracer can be used to analyze FTP performance.

Packet Tracer allows simulation of FTP connections in a network setup, letting users observe data transfer rates, packet delays, and the effect of different configurations on performance.
Why is FTP considered insecure, and what are alternatives?

FTP transmits data, including credentials, in plaintext, which can be intercepted. Alternatives include FTPS (FTP Secure) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol), which provide encrypted transfers.
How does HTTPS improve security over HTTP?

HTTPS uses SSL/TLS to encrypt data between the client and server, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data exchanged.
Can multiple clients connect to the same FTP server, and how does it manage connections?

Yes, multiple clients can connect to an FTP server simultaneously. The server assigns a unique session to each client, managing connections typically through port allocationsâ€‹(EXPT_7).
